# 🛡️ The Empathy Bridge - United Hacks V6

**Theme:** Human Interaction  
**Track:** Best Solo Hack / Theme Track

## 💡 The Problem
Online communication often lacks nuance. A simple disagreement can spiral into toxicity because we lack the "pause" button that exists in face-to-face interaction.

## 🚀 The Solution
**The Empathy Bridge** is a multi-agent AI system for Discord that acts as a real-time mediator. Instead of just banning users, it teaches them **Non-Violent Communication (NVC)**.

## ⚙️ How it Works
1. **Agent A (The Watcher):** Analyzes sentiment in real-time using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.
2. **Agent B (The Diplomat):** Intercepts toxic messages *before* damage is done and rewrites them using empathy frameworks.
3. **Agent C (The Coach):** Privately DMs the user with the better alternative, preserving their intent but removing the aggression.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **discord.py** (Interface)
- **Google Gemini API** (Intelligence)
